# CSV (Comma Separated Values)
# A file format that stores data in a tabular structure, where each row
# represents a table row and columns are separated by commas.
# It's widely used for data transfer between different systems and platforms,
# such as importing/exporting data to spreadsheets
# (Google Sheets, Excel, LibreOffice Calc) or databases.
# CSV files typically have a ".csv" extension and can be opened using text editors
# or spreadsheet software.
# Example CSV file:
# Name,Age,Address
# John Doe,32,"Av Brasil, 21, Centro"
# Joe Tho,55,"Rua 22, 44, Nova Era"
# The first line contains column headers, while subsequent lines hold row values,
# separated by commas.
#
# Simple rules for CSV files:
# 1 - Separate column values using a consistent delimiter (usually a comma).
# 2 - Each record must be on a new line.
# 3 - Avoid leaving empty lines or trailing spaces.
# 4 - Use an escape character (") when the delimiter appears within a value.
